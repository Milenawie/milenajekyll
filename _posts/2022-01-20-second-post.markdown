<span style="color:red"> It is important to remeber to wash your hands!</span>

I am going to start with my ultime favourite dish: Gołąbki
It's a slavish dish that i leanred form my mom and she learned it from her mom and so on.

Its essencially a cabbage roll filled with meat and rise serves with a tomato sauce.
We used to eat it with bread, the poop people style, but you don't have to enjoy it with a slice of bread 
  *I would recommend it tho*
