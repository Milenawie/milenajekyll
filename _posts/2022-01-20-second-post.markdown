<span style="color:red"> It is important to remeber to wash your hands!</span>

I am going to start with my ultime favourite dish: Gołąbki
It's a slavish dish that i leanred form my mom and she learned it from her mom and so on.

Its essencially a cabbage roll filled with meat and rise served with a tomato sauce.
We used to eat it with bread, the poop people style, but you don't have to enjoy it with a slice of bread. 
  *I would recommend it tho*
  

My go to recipie:
![Golabki-polnische-Kohlrouladen-mit-Tomatensoße](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96064736/150696632-a832d259-3b60-49cd-bb1c-633d76691f3e.jpg)

1. First cook some rice. 
2. Then you need to boil the cabbage head in a large pot.
3. You have to remove each outer leaf when it softened.
4. Once the leafs become too small to use you're done with the cabbage
5. Your rice should also be done by now.
6. Next, you should have some ground beef in a bowl. To that you add your rice
7. the ratio should be 2 to 1 rice to meat.
8. (That's how we always did it, since rice is cheaper)
9. Season to liking (Polish people only know salt, vegeta (chicken broth mix) ans pepper)
10. Cut off the hard part of the cabbage leaf where the root is (i think?)
11. And finally assamble. Put some of the meat and rice mixture in the leafe and fold and roll it.
12. Now you have to line the rolls in a backing sheet, *very important: put them on the seam*, very close to each other so a lot fits in one batch, and drizzle with oil.
13. Bake until the top is browning and then turn.
14. You should have a tomato sauce ready (i unfortunatly do not have a recipe for that)
15. Put some of the sauce in a lagre pan, cover with some cabbage rolls and fry until stained and tender.

There you have it.
*easy* 15 steps to the most delicious meal your tastebuds will ever come across.
Enjoy!
