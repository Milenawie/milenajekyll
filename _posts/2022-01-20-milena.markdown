## I want to tell you some funfacts about plants that i have recently came across!

I myself have a lot of different house plants.
Some are easier and some are a bit more difficult to take care of.

I used to like my philodendron, or the name most people know marble queen, but not anymore. She used to be my favourite.
But i didn't like how her leaves got smaller and smaller the more she grew.  

### Funfact number 1.
* If a plant grows downwards her leaves grow smaller.
* If a plant grows upwards her leaves grow bigger.


Let that sink in.


I own diffrent types of plants, and different sizes. And i can never water them all at the same time.


### Funfact number 2.
* The smaller the pot the more frequent you need to water your plant.


Hope i could amaze you with these facts.
